# azure-quiz-backend

Spring Boot REST API for the Microsoft Azure certifications revision app (AZ-900 to start, other certifications
like AZ-104 can be added later with no schema change — see "Data model" below).


## Stack

- Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.x, Maven
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, Flyway, Bean Validation, Lombok, Actuator
- Spring Data Redis (cache — see "Running locally" below)
- Spring Cloud Azure Storage Blob (quiz result export — see "Running locally" below)
- springdoc-openapi (Swagger UI)
- Tests: JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ

## Running locally

Prerequisites: JDK 21, Docker (Desktop or Engine) running.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run    # starts the API on http://localhost:8080
```

That's it — a plain `./mvnw spring-boot:run`, or hitting "Run" on `AzureQuizBackendApplication` in
your IDE, is enough on its own. The `spring-boot-docker-compose` dependency (pom.xml) detects
`docker-compose.yml` at the project root and automatically starts Postgres + Redis + Azurite (a
local Azure Blob Storage emulator) for you before the app context loads, then stops them when the
app stops — no manual `docker compose up -d` step. It's marked `optional`, so it never ships in the
production jar deployed to Azure App Service; this convenience is dev-only.

If you'd rather manage the containers yourself (e.g. keep them running across multiple app restarts
instead of stopping them every time), that still works exactly as before:

```bash
docker compose up -d      # starts Postgres + Redis + Azurite (see docker-compose.yml)
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Flyway applies the migrations (`src/main/resources/db/migration`) on startup, including the real content for
AZ-900 modules 1 to 6 (`V2` to `V7`, 45 questions per module: 30 standard questions + 15 scenario questions).
The 30 standard questions per module come from the trainer's answer key; the 15 scenario questions have no
written answer key (the trainer corrects them live) — their answers were determined from AZ-900 fundamentals
and deserve a quick review before use in training. One inconsistency was found and fixed in the trainer's
answer key: Module 1 Q8 marked "SaaS" as the answer while the explanation clearly describes PaaS — the
objectively correct answer (PaaS) was imported.

Six official mock exams (`V9` to `V14`, AZ900_Test_A to F, 50 questions each with answers/explanations
included in the same source document) are imported as modules of type `MOCK_EXAM` (`type` column on
`module`, migration `V8`). They stay strictly independent from each other and from course modules: the
random exam mode (`EXAM`) only draws from modules of type `CONTENT` (see
`QuestionRepository.findRandomActiveByCertification`).

`docker-compose up -d` also starts a local Redis (no auth, plaintext) backing
`CertificationService.getAllCertifications()` and `ModuleService.getModulesByCertification()`, both
`@Cacheable` (see `CacheConfig` for why values are JSON-serialized rather than the JDK-serialization
default). Entries expire after 30 minutes; there's no explicit eviction on writes, since the underlying
data (certifications/modules) only ever changes via a new Flyway migration, not through the running app.

Every call to `GET /api/quiz-sessions/{sessionId}/result` also exports that result as a JSON blob
(`QuizResultExportService`), downloadable again through `GET /api/quiz-sessions/{sessionId}/result/export`
— the simplest concrete use of the Storage Account provisioned for this TP. Locally this goes to Azurite;
in prod, to the `java-uploads-<owner>` container (Terraform's `storage-java.tf`), authenticated via this
Web App's managed identity, no account key involved either way (`shared_access_key_enabled = false` on
the account). A Storage outage never breaks the quiz itself — the export failing is only logged, not
thrown; Postgres stays the source of truth for results.

## Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## Environment variables (production)

The `default` profile (active locally) defines a localhost datasource in `application.yml`. In production,
set these environment variables (e.g. Azure App Service) — they directly override the corresponding Spring
properties, no extra profile needs activating:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` | PostgreSQL JDBC URL, e.g. `jdbc:postgresql://<host>:5432/azurequiz` |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` | PostgreSQL user |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Allowed origin(s), e.g. the frontend Static Web App URL |
| `REDIS_HOSTNAME` | Redis host, e.g. Azure Managed Redis's hostname |
| `REDIS_PORT` | Redis port. Defaults to `6379` (docker-compose) locally; Azure Managed Redis exposes a different port, see the infra repo's `redis.tf` |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | Redis access key. Empty locally (docker-compose's Redis has no auth) |
| `REDIS_SSL_ENABLED` | `true` in prod (Azure Managed Redis requires TLS), `false` locally |
| `BACKEND_API_KEY` | Shared secret the frontend must send as `X-Api-Key` (see `ApiKeyFilter`). Left unset locally — the check is skipped. In prod it's injected from Key Vault (see `app-service-java.tf` / `keyvault.tf` in the infra repo). |
| `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Storage Account name. Authenticated via this Web App's managed identity (no key) — see `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` below for why |
| `STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME` | Blob container for quiz result exports, e.g. `java-uploads-<owner>` |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | Set to `prod` by Terraform. Deactivates the `default` profile's local-only settings (localhost datasource, Azurite connection string) — without it, Blob Storage would try to reach a local Azurite that doesn't exist in Azure |

## Data model

`certification` (e.g. AZ-900, AZ-104...) → `module` → `question` → `answer_option`. A quiz session
(`quiz_session`) is tied to a certification and, in review mode, to a specific module; in exam mode,
questions are drawn randomly from all active modules of the chosen certification.

Adding a new certification requires no schema migration: just insert a row into `certification` and its
associated modules/questions (a dedicated Flyway migration, generated from the supplied content).

## API contract

- `GET /api/certifications` — list of available certifications
- `GET /api/certifications/{certificationId}/modules` — modules of a certification, with active question count and `type` (`CONTENT` or `MOCK_EXAM`)
- `POST /api/quiz-sessions` — creates a session
  - `MODULE` mode: `{ "mode": "MODULE", "moduleId": "..." , "questionCount": 10 }` (`questionCount` optional, otherwise all active questions in the module)
  - `EXAM` mode: `{ "mode": "EXAM", "certificationId": "...", "questionCount": 40 }` (`questionCount` optional, default 40)
  - the response contains the questions and their options **without** indicating the correct answer
- `POST /api/quiz-sessions/{sessionId}/questions/{questionId}/answer` — submits an answer, returns whether it's correct + the correct options + the explanation
- `GET /api/quiz-sessions/{sessionId}/result` — final aggregated score for the session; also exports it as a JSON blob (see "Running locally")
- `GET /api/quiz-sessions/{sessionId}/result/export` — downloads that exported blob (404 if `result` was never called for this session)


## Out of scope for this repo

- Provisioning Azure infrastructure (App Service, Static Web App, PostgreSQL Flexible Server)
- Importing the real question content (supplied separately, converted into Flyway migrations).
